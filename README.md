## Floppy Project #1

Project restrictions:
 - 1,44MB
 - shoudl run from a regular floppy
 - GLES2 (support low end GPU)
 - should run on latest flatpac Godot

### Prequisitions
You need to have a Godot Engine 3.1 runtime. If you don't have it it's super easy on Linux if you have flatpack installed (most distros have).
 - `flatpak install org.godotengine.Godot`

### How to run:

 - insert floppy
	- or download from internet like an animal
 - go to folder
 - `flatpak run org.godotengine.Godot`
